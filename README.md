See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) to find out what's new in each release.


## Running tests & linter

We run automated tests (for Python 2.6, 2.7 and PyPy) and flake8 linter for each repository push. View the logs at https://circleci.com/gh/abusesa/idiokit.

To run the tests locally you need to have [```tox```](http://tox.testrun.org/) installed (for example via ```pip install tox```). Then, while in the project directory, run:

```
$ tox
```
